# RFID_Based_Shoping_System
In metro cities we can see you a huge rush at shopping malls on holidays and weekends. This becomes even more when there are huge offers and discounts. Nowadays people purchase a variety of items and put them in the trolley. After total purchasing one should approach counter for billing purpose. By using barcode the cashier prepares the bill which is a time consuming process. This results in long queues at the billing counters. This project presents an idea to develop a system in shopping malls to overcome the above problem. To achieve this all products in the mall should be equipped with RFID tags and smart check-out counter. First of all customer must login / signup with the system. When one puts any product on RFID reader its code will be detected automatically, the item name and cost will be displayed on the LCD, thereby the cost gets added to the total bill. You need to continue this process until you complete with scanning of all the products. After completion, you may generate the bill which would be mailed to your registered account and the amount will be debited from your registered credit card. By doing this lot of time and man power can be saved.
